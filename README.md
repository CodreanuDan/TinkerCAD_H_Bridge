## ⚙️ Components Used:
- **NPN BJT Transistors**: Control the current flow through the DC motor, enabling directional control.
- **Capacitors**: Stabilize voltage fluctuations and reduce noise in the circuit.
- **Potentiometer**: Adjusts the motor speed by controlling the current flowing to it.
- **LEDs**: Indicate the direction of the motor's rotation. A red LED is placed in parallel with the potentiometer to provide a visual indication of speed adjustments.
- **Button**: Switches the H-Bridge on and off to control the motor operation.
- **Measuring Devices**: Monitor circuit parameters, such as voltage and current, for optimal performance.

## ✨ Features:
- **Direction Control**: Easily switch between clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the DC motor.
- **Speed Adjustment**: Fine-tune the motor speed using the potentiometer.
- **Visual Feedback**: LEDs provide immediate visual feedback on the motor's rotation direction and speed.

## 📘 Why Use an H-Bridge?
An H-Bridge circuit is a simple yet powerful solution for controlling DC motors. It allows for both direction and speed control by selectively switching the transistors on and off. This is particularly useful in robotics, automotive systems, and other applications where precise motor control is needed.

Feel free to tinker with the circuit in TinkerCAD and experiment with different configurations to better understand the principles of an H-Bridge!
