## ‚öôÔ∏è Components Used:
- **NPN BJT Transistors**: Control the current flow through the DC motor, enabling directional control.
- **Capacitors**: Stabilize voltage fluctuations and reduce noise in the circuit.
- **Potentiometer**: Adjusts the motor speed by controlling the current flowing to it.
- **LEDs**: Indicate the direction of the motor's rotation. A red LED is placed in parallel with the potentiometer to provide a visual indication of speed adjustments.
- **Button**: Switches the H-Bridge on and off to control the motor operation.
- **Measuring Devices**: Monitor circuit parameters, such as voltage and current, for optimal performance.

## ‚ú® Features:
- **Direction Control**: Easily switch between clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the DC motor.
- **Speed Adjustment**: Fine-tune the motor speed using the potentiometer.
- **Visual Feedback**: LEDs provide immediate visual feedback on the motor's rotation direction and speed.
